#----------VARIABLES---------
	# Thanks to 
	# Jacob Salmela
	# https://bitbucket.org/jacob_salmela/geeklets
	# For color codes

	# These variables are to give the text color, which makes the scripts more useful
	# At a glance, you can tell if the system is in good shape (green), has a minor problem (yellow), or needs immediate attention (red)
	# The end variable is required to show where the coloring should end
	# An example would be if you only wanted one word to be color, that word would need to end with the $end variable
	# See more colors and options here:
	# http://www.csc.uvic.ca/~sae/seng265/fall04/tips/s265s047-tips/bash-using-colors.html
	#
	# If the colors are not working, try changing any echo commands to printf. 
	# If you make this change, you will also need to add a \n to the end of the commands so it goes to a newline
	# If you want to use echo, make sure the #!/bin/bash is not the first line and then echos will print the colors just fine
